#### [Cover Coverage Status][code-coverage]  | [Maven Central Location][maven-central]

## Project Overview

In [Jenkins][jenkins-site], there are several categories of user-initiated actions, such as:
- Starting and/or stopping a Jenkins build.
- Creating, Modifying and/or Deleting a Jenkins Job.
- Performing a change to the Jenkins configuration settings.
- **TODO:** Add some other user-actions

During the operation of Jenkins other events and actions occur which are not initiated by the user, for example:
- Jenkins system agent joins or leaves a Jenkins cluster.
- Authentication and Authorization of a new user succeeds or fails.
- Generation of system events due to a build succeeding or failing.
- Build-specific Jenkins events occur
- **TODO:** Add some others non-user or system actions

The goal of this project is to utilize [Apache Log4j Audit][log4j-audit-site], which is an audit logging framework, to implement the logging of audit events within the Jenkins server.
This requires the following tasks, among other project objectives:
- Identification and definition of the audit events of importance.
- Performing updates to the Jenkins Core system to support any additional event-listeners needed, for example, for acquiring audit information.
- Creation of new audit events, with the provision of customizable interfaces for user-defined configurations. For example;
    - Enable users to configure how audit logs are stored and used.
    - Provide admin settings to configure and add a relational database or local directory to write log files into.
    - Enable users to configure and add an external syslog server.
    - **TODO:** Add some other use cases
- **TODO:** Add more use cases and applications of the plugin

Getting Started: Prerequisites
---------------

+ Make sure you have a [JIRA account][jira-site].
+ Make sure you have a [GitHub account][github-site].
+ If you're planning to implement a new feature, it makes sense to discuss your changes
  on [Gitter][project-gitter] first.
  This way you can make sure you're not wasting your time on something that isn't
  considered to be in the audit-logging project's scope.
+ Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  + Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  + Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
+ Fork the [repository][project-repo] on GitHub, take a look at the [project's JIRA page][project-jira] and [Wiki][project-wiki].

Getting Started: Setup
----------------------

**TODO:** - how to setup/start the plugin with Jenkins, etc



Usage
----------------------

**TODO:** - demo, screenshot, gifs of running audit logging, etc


Contributing to the Audit Log Project
--------------------------

We accept Pull Requests via GitHub. The [gitter][project-gitter] is the
main channel of communication for contributors.

Before you dig right into the code, there are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of
things and it makes applying PRs easier for us:
+ Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (this is usually the master branch).
  Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
+ Make commits of logical units.
+ Respect the original code style: by using the same [codestyle][code-style], patches should only highlight the actual difference, not being disturbed by any formatting issues:
  + Only use spaces for indentation.
  + Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports.
    If you feel the source code should be reformatted, create a separate PR for this change.
  + Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
+ Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. Your commit message should contain the key of the JIRA issue.
```
[JENKINS-XXX] - Subject of the JIRA Ticket

 Optional supplemental description.
```
+ Make sure you have added the necessary tests (JUnit/IT) for your changes.
+ Run all the tests with `mvn -Prun-its verify` to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
+ Submit a pull request to the repository in the Jenkins project.
+ Update your JIRA ticket and include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
+ For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not always necessary to
create a new ticket in JIRA.  In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit
with '(doc)' instead of a ticket number.
